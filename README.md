## My process

This project at first gave me a big headache, but with patience and a lot of thinking, i worked with Mobile-first workflow, media queries and some custom properties like float, border-radius, etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom propertie
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A better understanding of media queries and "bug solving" in a web page. 
Learned the basic of making buttons and using icons, etc.

### Continued development

Understanding some bugs in CSS, how they work and get a better understanding of Website models. In a near future, make my development time easier with frameworks, but first, get a deeper understanding of HTML5 and CSS.
